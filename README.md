# Installation

Install using pip:

```bash
pip install fgrequests
```

# Documentation

Pretty easy to use.

```python
import fgrequests

urls = [
    'https://google.com',
    'https://facebook.com',
    'https://twitter.com',
    'https://linkedin.com',
    'https://fakedomain.com'
]
```

Now lets make requests at the same time to the list of URLs (`urls`)

```python
>>> response = fgreuests.build(urls)
>>> print(response)
[<Response [200]>, <Response [200]>, <Response [200]>, <Response [200]>, None]

```

By default `fgrequests.build()` returns a list of responses. If there have any invalid URL, the response will be `None`.

By default this `build()` using `GET` method. There is a parameter which accepts methods named `method`. You can change this according to your need. `method` will accept these: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`.

Lets send `POST` request in all of the `urls`

```python
>>> response = fgreuests.build(urls, method='POST')
>>> print(response)
[<Response [405]>, <Response [200]>, <Response [200]>, <Response [200]>, None]
```

If you want to pass any `headers` you can simply pass your `headers` object (which may contain the authentication information) if you do like this:

```python
>>> headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/39.0.2171.95 Safari/537.36',
    "Authorization": "Bearer XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXTOKEN"
}
>>> response = fgreuests.build(urls, headers=headers)
```

If you want to pass additional information while making requests, just pass your `params` / `payload` by following way:

```python
>>> data = {
    'username': 'farid'
    'password': 'password123'
}
>>> response = fgreuests.build(urls, data=data)
```

It has another parameter `worker`. By default the value of `worker` is `40`. If you increase this it will work more faster. But there is a problem if you increase this too much, this will make a lot of pressure in your `CPU` cores which may freeze your system. If you reduce the value of `worker` you this will take more time to return responses. You can change the value of worker like this:

```python
>>> response = fgreuests.build(urls, worker=70)
```

There have another parameter named `show_execution_time`. It returns the execution time (in sec). It accepts `Boolean`, either `True` or `False`. By default it is `False`. If you change this to `True` then `fgrequests.build()` will return an `object`. Lets check the output by making `show_execution_time` to `True`:

```python
>>> response = fgrequests.build(urls, show_execution_time=True)
>>> print(response)
{
    'response_list': [<Response [200]>, <Response [200]>, <Response [200]>, <Response [200]>, None],
    'execution_time': 1.677
}
```
